*Firmware Update menu*

From time to time SparkFun will release new firmware for the RTK product line to add and improve functionality. For most users, firmware can be upgraded over WiFi using the [OTA method](https://docs.sparkfun.com/SparkFun_RTK_Firmware/firmware_update/#updating-firmware-over-the-air).

The Firmware Update menu allows users to check for and install updates. Turning on *Automatic firmware updates* will cause the device to periodically check and install update when they become available. This can be helpful for remote stations that cannot have manual interventions.
