# Connecting Over WiFi


Surveyor: Yes* / Express: Yes / Express Plus: Yes / Facet: Yes

Starting with firmware v1.7, WiFi based configuration is supported. For more information about updating the firmware on your device, please see [Firmware Updates and Customization](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-rtk-facet-hookup-guide/all#firmware-updates-and-customization).

The RTK device will present a webpage that is viewable from either a desktop/laptop with WiFi or a cell phone. For advanced configurations, a desktop is recommended. For quick in-field changes, a cell phone works great.

To get into WiFi configuration follow these steps:

1. Power on the RTK Facet.
2. Once the device has started press the Setup button repeatedly until the *Config* menu is highlighted.
3. The RTK Facet will blink a WiFi icon indicating it is waiting for incoming connections.
4. Connect to WiFi network named ‘RTK Config’.
5. Open a browser (Chrome is preferred) and type **192.168.4.1** into the address bar.
