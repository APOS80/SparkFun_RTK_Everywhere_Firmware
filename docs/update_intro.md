# Firmware Updates

The RTK Facet is open source hardware meaning you have total access to the [firmware](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Firmware) and [hardware](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Facet). Be sure to checkout each repo for the latest firmware and hardware information. But for those who want to jump right in and tweak the firmware, we will discuss various methods.
