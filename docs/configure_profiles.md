Profiles are a very powerful feature. A profile is a complete copy of all the settings on the RTK product. Switching profiles changes all the settings in one step. This is handy for creating a complex setup for surveying, and a different setup for a NTRIP enabled base station. Rather than changing the variety of parameters, a user can simply switch profiles.

If more than one profile is defined, the profiles will be displayed and selectable by using the **Power/Setup** button. Profiles can be named up to 50 characters; only the first 7 characters will be shown on the menu.
