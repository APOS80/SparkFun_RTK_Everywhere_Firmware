The Reference Station send and receive NTRIP correction data via Ethernet. It can also send NMEA and RTCM navigation messages to an external TCP Server via Ethernet.
It also has a dedicated Configure-Via-Ethernet (*Cfg Eth*) mode which is accessed via the MODE button and OLED display.

By default, the Reference Station will use DHCP to request an IP Address from the network Gateway. But you can optionally configure it with a fixed IP Address.
