*Firmware update taking place*

From time to time SparkFun will release new firmware for the RTK Facet to add and improve functionality. For most users, firmware can be upgraded by loading the appropriate firmware file from the [binaries repo folder](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Firmware/tree/main/Binaries/For_SD_Loading) onto the SD card and bringing up the firmware menu as shown above.

The firmware upgrade menu will only display files that have the "RTK_Surveyor_Firmware*.bin" file name format so don't change the file names once loaded onto the SD card. Select the firmware you'd like to load and the system will proceed to load the new firmware, then reboot.

Note: The firmware is called `RTK_Surveyor_Firmware_vXX.bin` even though this product is called the *RTK Facet*. We united the different platforms into one. The [RTK Firmware](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Firmware) runs on all our RTK products.
