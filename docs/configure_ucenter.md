# Configuring ZED-F9P with u-center

Note: Because the ESP32 does considerable configuration of the ZED-F9P at power on it is not recommended to modify the settings of the ZED-F9P. Nothing will break but your changes may be overwritten.

The ZED-F9P module can be configured independently using the u-center software from u-blox by connecting a USB cable to the *Config u-blox* USB connector. Settings can be saved to the module between power cycles.
