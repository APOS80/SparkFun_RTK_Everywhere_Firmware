<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<strong>Note:</strong> Firmware versions 1.1 to 1.9 have an issue that severely limit firmware upload over WiFi and is not recommended; use the 'Updating Firmware From the SD Card' method instead. Firmware versions v1.10 and beyond support direct firmware update via WiFi and is the preferred method for updating the firmware on a unit.</div>

Alternatively, firmware may be uploaded via the WiFi AP interface. 

**Versions 1.1 to 1.9:** For firmware versions 1.1 to 1.9, the upload process is limited in speed resulting in upload times of nearly 2 minutes. Because of this, we recommend using the 'Updating Firmware From the SD Card' method instead. If you do upload firmware over WiFi, once it has been uploaded it will be viewable on the 'Available Firmware' on the page. To prevent accidental loading the *Enable Firmware Update* checkbox must first be checked before the button is enabled.

**Versions 1.10 and Greater:** Firmware may be uploaded to the unit by clicking on 'Choose File', selecting the binary such as 'RTK_Surveyor_Firmware_v1_xx.bin' and pressing upload. The unit will automatically reset once firmware upload is complete.
